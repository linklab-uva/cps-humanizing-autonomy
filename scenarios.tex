    \caption{Overview of the Scenario Based Emotion and Trust Measurement - We recreate real world traffic situations in simulation using Pre-Scan. During experimentation, we invite human drivers to first manually drive through each scenario (mode 1), followed by an autonomous driving mode where limited feedback and car intentions are provided to the driver, and finally in mode 3, the users experience fully autonomous driving with full feedback and situational awareness provided. We then survey the participants about what feedback enables their trust, which UI elements do they prefer, which mode made them emotionally satisfied.  }
