\section{Project Management and Collaboration Plan}
\label{sec:plan}
This is an ambitious proposal which addresses challenging problems in autonomous vehicles, but we have an excellent team with broad and complementary skills, the facilities to support it, and a strong basis to start from.
The proposed work will be performed by the PIs, and 4 graduate students.

Madhur Behl: (NSF-1735587); $\$2,499,238$; 09/1/2017-08/31/2021 Title: CRISP Type 2: dMIST: Data-driven Management for Interdependent Stormwater and Transportation Systems. Role: Co-PI. Intellectual Merit: To create a novel decision support system denoted dMIST (Data-driven Management for Interdependent Stormwater and Transportation Systems) to improve management of interdependent transportation and stormwater infrastructure systems. Behl's role on this project is the development of a novel modeling and control framework called Data Predictive Control (DPC) for assisting decision makers in understanding and managing interdependent critical infrastructure systems. Broader impact: The research is intended to have broad impact related to national economic and security interests due to its focus on sea level rise. Paper submitted to $11^{th}$ International Conference on Urban Drainiage Modeling.
